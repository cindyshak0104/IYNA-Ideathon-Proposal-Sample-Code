# IYNA-Ideathon-Proposal-Sample-Code

The dataset csv files were reformatted by us to generate volcano plots.
Source of original datasets: 
- (Lungs) MassIVE: MSV000086003 (Mahood/Jha et al.)  https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=f081e82b47174c2bbe49f9d4aef0c27e 
- (Microglia) ProteomeXchange/PRIDE: PXD009137 (Rangaraju et al., 2018)  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009137

This analysis serves as a predictive feasibility checks, inequivalent to the actual proteomics outlined in our proposal. The datasets are the closest proxies we can find for our study.
